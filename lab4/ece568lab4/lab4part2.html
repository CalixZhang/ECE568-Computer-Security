<!-- Explanation
	The iinout filed with name = field1 does input validation on server side and if its not a vaid input, it prints the output on the screen.
	So I entered in a script that would change the error message to "Congratulations. You have successfully completed this lesson.".
-->

<script type  = "text/javascript">
	var div = document.getElementById('message');
	div.innerHTML =  "Congratulations. You have successfully completed this lesson.";
</script>
