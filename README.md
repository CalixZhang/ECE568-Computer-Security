#Computer Security

For more info, read explanations text file which are under every lab directory.

## Lab 1 
Parts 1 to 4 are about buffer overflows and compulsary for full completion of the lab. There also bonus parts which include format string invulnerabilites as part 5, and double free vulnerabilities as part 6.
The objective of these labs was to craft a buffer overflow attack to change the return address to point to injected shellcode.

- Finished parts 1-4 about buffer overflows
- Finished part 6 about double free attack
- Have my notes which have diagrams of stack, heap, addresses, attack buffers and offsets from each other
- To run each of the spolits, just do ./sploit(which part)
